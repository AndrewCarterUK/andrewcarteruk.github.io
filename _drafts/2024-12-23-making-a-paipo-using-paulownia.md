This year, in the secret santa gift exchange for my partner's side of the family, I was assigned the responsibility of providing a gift for somebody who likes to spend time at the beach. After doing some research, I decided that I was going to set upon the challenge of building a paipo. A paipo is a traditional Polynesian bellyboard, the name is derived from the Hawaiian "Pae Po'o", which means to surf headfirst.

I wanted the paipo to be wooden, and my research led me to select paulownia as the best species to use. Paulownia is lightweight, easy to work, and has water-resistant properties. I purchased a 25mm edge-glued panel from a UK supplier called [Paulownia Timber](https://www.paulowniatimber.co.uk/paulownia-edge-glued-panels). The dimensions of the panel I purchased were 2400x600mm, and I wanted the paipo to be 1200x390mm, giving me enough material for three boards with some additional gluing. I'd highly recommend this supplier. When I called them up to speak about my plans, Patrick was very helpful and informative.

There is lots of online debate about the best shape for a paipo. From what I can tell, basically any wooden plank can be used to catch waves, so there was no need to build something overly complicated. The features I decided upon were:

- A rounded nose and a double crescent tail.
- Widest at the front, tapering towards the back.
- A flat deck. Most of the designs that I could find online had a lift in the nose. This was usually accomplished by either steam bending a plywood panel or laminating thin sheets together on a rocker jig. I didn't want to weaken the glue on my paulownia panel by steam bending it, so I decided instead to create a small lift in the nose by planing it to a thinner dimension at the front.
- A "double concave" bottom. The theory goes that a concave bottom will act like a hydrofoil and generate lift. I decided on two channels mostly because I liked the look of them and thought it would be fun.

## Creating the top profile

I used my table saw to rip a 1200x390mm blank from the paulownia panel, and then ripped some scrap hardboard to the half-width dimension (1200x195mm) to use as a template. I traced the shape that I wanted onto the hardboard, bending thin strips of wood around some nails to generate smooth curves, and then cut it out on the bandsaw. I tidied up the edges of the template on my belt sander and then used the template to mark the full shape on the paulownia blank.

I cut the shape out on the bandsaw and tidied up the edges using a block plane and the belt sander. Then, I rounded over the edges using my router, setting a deeper cut on the bottom edge of the nose. This deeper cut would form the lift in the nose, and give me a target line to plane to.

## Creating the bottom profile

Most of the work of this project was done with the hand plane, and it was probably the most fun I have had in the workshop. Paulownia is very easy to work, and with a project like this, there aren't any wrong answers. Gradually the shape I was aiming at came to life. The block plane wasn't the best tool for removing the material for my concave channels (it's designed to make things flat!). I had to get progressively more and more aggressive with the blade setting once my channel emerged, and a lot of sanding was required to clean up afterward.
