This year, in our family secret santa game, I was assigned the responsibility for providing a gift for somebody who likes to spend time at the beach. After doing some research, I decided that I was going to set upon the challenge of building a paipo. A paipo is a traditional Polynesian bellyboard, the name is derived from the Hawaiian "Pae Po'o", which means to surf headfirst.

I wanted the paipo to be wooden, and my research led me to selecting paulownia as the best species to use. Paulownia is lightweight, easy to work and has water resistant properties. I purchased a 25mm thickness edge-glued panel from a UK supplier called [Paulownia Timber](https://www.paulowniatimber.co.uk/paulownia-edge-glued-panels). The dimensions of the panel I purchased was 2400x600mm, and I wanted the paipo to be 1200x390mm, giving me enough for three boards with some additional gluing.

There is lots of debate online about the best shape, and from what I can tell basically any wooden plank can be used to catch waves. Indeed, bodysurfing itself is a sport, so there was no need to build something overly complicated. The features I decided upon were:

- A flat deck. Most of the designs that I could find online had a lift in the nose. This was usually accomplished by either steam bending a plywood panel or laminating thin sheets together on a rocker jig. I didn't want to weaken the glue on my paulownia panel by steam bending it, so I decided instead to create a small lift in the nose by planing it to a thinner dimension at the front.
- A "double concave" bottom. The theory goes that a concave bottom will act like a hydrofoil and generate lift. I decided on two channels mostly because I liked the look of them and thought it would be fun.
- A rounded nose.
- Wide at the front, tapering towards the back.
