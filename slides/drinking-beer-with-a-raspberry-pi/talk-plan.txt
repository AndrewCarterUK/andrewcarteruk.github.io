1. INTRODUCTION
	* Hardware seems much more complicated than it is
	* In 2016, the jump between the worlds is far smaller than before
	* We'll be investigating how we, as software developers, can make this jump

2. WHO AM I
	* Andrew Carter, @AndrewCarterUK on Twitter
	* Recently graduated from the University of Warwick with a Masters Degree in Physics
	* Worked as a web developer up until July, now work as an embedded software engineer

3. WHAT IS A RASPBERRY PI?
	* A teeny, tiny computer
	* Hard drive -> SD card, HDMI out -> Graphics card
	* Different models:
		- Raspberry Pi 3, on board WiFi
		- Pi Zero
	* Raspbian
	* GPIO
		- Water analogy
		- Digital logic, on-off, 1-0
		- Inputs: button presses, sensors
		- Outputs: LEDs, motors, anything you want to turn on or off
	* Arduino
		- Also provides programmable GPIO pins
		- Micro-controller has direct access to the hardware
		- Raspberry Pi operates like a normal computer does, user level applications do not have direct control

4. RASPBERRY PI TIPS
	* Be careful what you plug where, observe voltage and current requirements
		- How much should you open the dam to power the mill?
		- LED maths - 3.3V 200mA, what resistor?
		- Some digital systems operate on 5V, some on 3.3V, some on both
	* Create images of SD cards once you've set them up for your project
	* SD cards aren't the most reliable form of long term storage
	* Use a static IP address on the network, configure it in your hosts file
	* Access Point mode with hostapd - create a travel router / private WiFi network for control

5. COMMUNICATION: PIPHP/GPIO
	* Install via composer
	* Toggling output pin
	* Interrupt handling

6. COMMUNICATION: Serial
	* Single wire required for each direction of communication, TX and RX
	* Explain protocol, start bit, stop bit
	* Demonstration: clapping
	* Internal clock required
	* Raspberry Pi 3 clock issue - changed with processor speed
	* GPS device
	* Raspberry Pi Theft Detection System

7. DRINKING MACHINE
	* Alcohol as a service
	* Controlling more powerful circuits with transistors
	* Code walk through
	* Demonstration

8. QUESTIONS

"Dear The Feds,

This automated message is to notify you that a 25$ micro-computer which was recently stolen from me has been switched on at this location: 32.412, -0.021.

Please could you send a SWAT team around to recover my property at the earliest opportunity.

Kthnxbai"
